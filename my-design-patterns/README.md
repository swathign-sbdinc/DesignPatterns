# React Design Patterns Sandbox

Welcome to the React Design Patterns Sandbox! This repository serves as a sandbox to experiment with various design patterns commonly used in React applications. Through this project, you can gain hands-on experience and sharpen your understanding of how each design pattern affects code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

## Design Patterns Covered

### Container/Component Pattern

In the Container/Component pattern, you'll find two types of components: container components and presentational components. This pattern promotes improved code organization, reusability, and collaboration among developers.

### Render Props Pattern

The Render Props pattern introduces reusable components that use a render prop to pass rendering logic to child components. This enables high reusability and flexibility in rendering different UI elements.

### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that wrap components, providing additional props or behavior. This pattern focuses on reusability and separation of concerns.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state, context, and other React features in functional components. They offer code organization and improved readability compared to class components.

## Repository Structure

- `src/components`: Contains example implementations for each design pattern.
- `src/App.js`: A usage example where different design patterns are applied.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point of the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

Feel free to explore the code in the `src/components` directory to understand how each design pattern is implemented.
