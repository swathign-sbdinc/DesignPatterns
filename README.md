## Container/Component Pattern

### Description
The Container/Component pattern involves dividing components into two categories: container components and presentational components. Container components manage data logic and state, while presentational components focus solely on rendering UI.

### Pros
- Clean separation of concerns.
- Improved code organization and maintainability.
- Enhanced component reusability.
- Facilitates easier testing.

### Cons
- Slight increase in boilerplate code due to separate container components.

### Suitability
Ideal for larger applications where data management and UI rendering can be decoupled. Promotes reusability and maintainability.

### Example
Check [ContainerComponent.js](./ContainerComponent.js) and [PresentationalComponent.js](./PresentationalComponent.js).
```jsx
// ContainerComponent.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchData } from '../actions';
import PresentationalComponent from './PresentationalComponent';

class ContainerComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.fetchData();
  }

  render() {
    return <PresentationalComponent data={this.props.data} />;
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  data: state.data
});
export default connect(mapStateToProps, { fetchData })(ContainerComponent);

// PresentationalComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const PresentationalComponent = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    {data.map(item => (
      <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
    ))}
  </div>
);

export default PresentationalComponent;
```

## Presentational/Component Pattern

### Description
An extension of the container/component pattern, the Presentational/Component pattern further divides components into presentational and container components. Presentational components handle UI rendering, while container components handle data logic.

### Pros
- Clear separation of concerns.
- High component reusability.
- Improved code readability.

### Cons
- May result in a larger number of small components, which could be overwhelming in small projects.

### Suitability
Ideal for projects with complex UIs that require a high level of reusability and modularity.

### Example
Check [PresentationalComponent.js](./PresentationalComponent.js) and [ContainerComponent.js](./ContainerComponent.js).
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PresentationalComponent = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    {data.map(item => (
      <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { fetchData } from '../actions';
import PresentationalComponent from './PresentationalComponent';

class ContainerComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.fetchData();
  }

  render() {
    return <PresentationalComponent data={this.props.data} />;
  }
}

export default ContainerComponent;
export default PresentationalComponent;
```

## Render Props

### Description
The Render Props pattern is a technique used in React where a component receives a function as a prop. This function, known as the render function, provides content that the component will render. It's a way to share behavior between components without relying on inheritance or complex component hierarchies.

### Pros
- Highly flexible and dynamic approach to component composition.
- Promotes code sharing and reusability, as multiple components can use the same render function.
- Allows decoupling of behavior from components, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Cons
- May lead to nested components and layers of indentation if not managed properly.
- Can introduce a learning curve for those unfamiliar with the pattern.

### Suitability
Effective for scenarios where you want to share behavior between components that don't have a direct parent-child relationship. It's particularly useful when you need dynamic rendering and customization.

### Example
Check [RenderPropsComponent.js](./RenderPropsComponent.js).

---
### RenderPropsComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const RenderPropsComponent = ({ renderFunction }) => (
  <div>
    {renderFunction('Hello from Render Props')}
  </div>
);

export default RenderPropsComponent;
```

###Usage:
You can use the RenderPropsComponent by passing a render function as a prop.
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import RenderPropsComponent from './RenderPropsComponent';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <RenderPropsComponent
      renderFunction={content => <h1>{content}</h1>}
    />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

### Description
Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a design pattern in React where functions are used to enhance components by adding extra functionality. HOCs take a base component and return an extended version of that component, allowing the addition of shared behaviors without altering the original component's implementation.

### Pros
- Enables efficient code reuse and separation of concerns by encapsulating common functionality in HOCs.
- Modifies component behavior without requiring changes to the underlying component itself.
- Offers an organized approach to managing cross-cutting concerns.

### Cons
- May lead to "wrapper hell," where multiple layers of nested HOCs can complicate the component hierarchy.
- Can increase the complexity of understanding component behavior due to the indirect nature of modifications.

### Suitability
Ideal for scenarios where you want to add consistent and reusable functionalities to multiple components across your application.

### Example
Check [withLogger.js](./withLogger.js).
```jsx
// withLogger.js
import React from 'react';

const withLogger = WrappedComponent => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component did mount');
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};

export default withLogger;
---
Usage:
Apply the HOC to a component to add logging behavior.

```jsx
jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import withLogger from './withLogger';

const ComponentWithLogger = withLogger(MyComponent);

export default ComponentWithLogger;
```

## Hooks

### Description
Hooks are special functions in React that allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. They provide a more concise and functional approach to managing state, lifecycle, and side effects in functional components.

### Pros
- Simplifies component logic by encapsulating stateful and side-effectful code within functions.
- Avoids the complexity of class components and eliminates the need for constructor and lifecycle methods.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability by promoting a more straightforward component structure.

### Cons
- Requires a mindset shift for developers accustomed to class components and traditional React practices.
- Some custom hooks might not be as performant as their class component equivalents, depending on how they're implemented.

### Suitability
Perfect for modern React applications that aim to efficiently manage state, lifecycle, and side effects. Hooks are particularly useful in functional components, making them a core feature of contemporary React development.

### Example
Check [useCounter.js](./useCounter.js).
Custom Hook:
Here's an example of a custom hook for managing a simple counter.

```jsx
// useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';

const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return { count, increment };
};

export default useCounter;
```
Usage:
Use the useCounter custom hook in a functional component.

```jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import useCounter from './useCounter';

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```
